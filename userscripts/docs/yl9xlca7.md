### General
- The general ratings average is weighted by votes, to account for the inaccurate ratings of unreleased seasons/episodes.
- Specials are always excluded, except on the specials season page.
- Only visible (i.e. not hidden by a filter) items are used for the calculation of the averages and changes to those filters trigger a recalculation.
