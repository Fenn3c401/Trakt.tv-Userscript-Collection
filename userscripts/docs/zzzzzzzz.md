## Info
### General
- You can disable individual modules by setting the corresponding id to `false` in the userscript storage tab *(note: only displayed after first run)*.
- Each enabled module will conflict with the corresponding standalone userscript. Either uninstall the standalone version (suggested) or disable the respective module.
- As VIP user you should disable: `2dz6ub1t`, `fyk2l3vj`, `x70tru7b`, `2hc6zfyy`
- This userscript is automatically generated. YMMV.
